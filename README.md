## Kim's Dotfiles

Finally version controlling these.

Set up by cloning this repo then running `setup.sh` (make sure to do this from within this dotfiles directory).

### Hammerspoon
I've also included my [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) `init.lua` script. It's pretty janky and includes:

* window resizing
* jumping to popular apps
* an ugly Slack API polling menubar item

Symlink it similarly to use it.
